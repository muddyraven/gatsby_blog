This is my second blog post in Gatsby.

I've had three spinal surgeries over the years, and back pain has been killer, but I'm determined to progress, learn and create.  I have some further medical appointments soon, hopefully they will result in positive outcomes.

Learning and coding has been a massive way for me to escape, and disappear into my mind. It has given me new focus and growth. I hope I can continue this journey, being paid to build things with code one day would be ineffable...
