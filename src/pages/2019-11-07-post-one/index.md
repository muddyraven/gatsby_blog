This is my very first blog post in Gatsby.

It was a lot of work and I clearly still have lots to learn, but I'm making good progress so far.  I encountered two tricky little bugs throwing errors in the command line caused by simple typos, but using the graphiql tool and the chrome developer tools console, I was able to track and solve them.

Woohoo! =)
